# Open Core Strategy

## 🎯 What is Open Core?

**Open Core** is a business model where the core protocol is open-source (MIT License), while advanced features, production infrastructure, and commercial components require a commercial license.

## 🔄 License Migration

If you start with open-source and later need commercial features:

1. **Contact Us** - Reach out to contact@allianza.tech
2. **Discuss Needs** - We'll discuss your specific requirements
3. **License Agreement** - Sign commercial license agreement
4. **Access Granted** - Get access to commercial components

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use the open-source code in production?

**A:** The protocol code is available for study and non-commercial use. For production deployment with commercial features, a commercial license is required.

### Q: What's the difference between open-source and commercial?

**A:** Open-source includes the protocol code, documentation, and examples. Commercial includes production infrastructure, enterprise features, and support.

### Q: Can I contribute to commercial components?

**A:** Commercial components are in a private repository. However, you can contribute to open-core components, which may influence commercial features.

### Q: How do I know if I need a commercial license?

**A:** If you're deploying in production, using commercially, or need enterprise features, you need a commercial license. Contact us to discuss your specific needs.

### Q: Can I audit the commercial code?

**A:** Commercial license holders can audit the commercial components as part of their license agreement.
